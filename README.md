# Headless Frontend

This headless frontent website app is a template that I'm using to run my websites. It consumes content from my headless github-based CMS app. Both apps were built on the foundation of [personal-website-next-js]() code used to run my personal website [vadimgierko.com](https://vadimgierko.com) from 2022 to September 2025.
